# Walkthrough Demo:

In DArt, each team is allocated a canvas of size 2000* 1000. Various portions of the canvas can be allocated to collaborators to work on independently, which can be merged with the main canvas once it is approved of by the owner. The overall painting can be minted as an DArt NFT with signatures from collaborators and the owner.

## Step1: 

**Add wallet address of collaborators and allocate sections of canvas**
